JSON requests should be like (regardless of GET or POST usage):  
{  
"action": action to give the executable (like `search`)  
"payload" : json data that will be serialized to tmp file, the path will be sent to jar/bin (file will be deleted after request is done)    
} 

JSON response should be like:  
{  
"code": 200 or 500 or whatever  
"error" : "" if error not empty (errors might be, jar not found or such)  
"date": "2019-02-20 20:15:85"  
"body" : some JSON body response or empty if error  
}  

##### TODO:
- implement tests  

v1: 
 - no UI needed, (Ui will be done on requester side), only possibility to listen for requests and execute jar
 (this might come from an Android app, initially)

v2:
 - add Controller/s for UI rendering, use that as entry point
 - add support for html UI (so the requester doesn't need to provide Ui rendering)
